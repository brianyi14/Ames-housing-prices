# Ames Housing Prices

Brian Yi, Alexa Edwards, Erica Chen, Minerva Fang

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a model for the Ames Housing dataset to predict housing prices. We first select a model through backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise regression. Then we conduct residual analysis for this model to identify outliers. We then take our model out for a run to predict a housing price to see if the results are reasonable.

Next, we transform our model such that predictors will have a stronger correlation with our dependent variable, price. We finally conduct some cross-validation on our non-transformed model to see if our model does well in predicting on a test dataset.
